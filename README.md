# Exploring Imaginary and Real Data from Netflix and my Friend

Practice of Data Exploration with Python with Netflix data.
You can run the file in your computer as long as you have an interpreter of jupyter nootebooks. Or also can copy and paste the parts you're interested in in a google collab. It's up to you. 

This practice follows the requirements of the course of Data Science from DataCamp Python Intermediate. Taking advantage of the three months for free I have in the platform thanks to GitHub for students.
